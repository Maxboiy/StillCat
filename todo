It works

For version v1.0
 - Have an stable built and a non-verbose version
 - The if deployed_cats == X then send POST request or error pop-up

Program itself
 - self-destruction date for program (With a start and end date)
 - Open up random cat facts in message boxes (This feature can most likely not be enabled if the other features are running!)
 - Checks if Windows photos app is open and program terminates photos app if a certain number has been reached
       - If photos app is open this function will probably be disabled to prevent annoying the enduser too much 

JSON configs
 - Custom cat facts messages and if you want to disable/enable certain ones
 - Max cat facts boxes allowed
 - Cat facts should probably also work with the random wait and static wait function

 - Finish working on a (for now) Terminal JSON editor

add a custom program for displaying the pictures
 - make it so you have to press it 10 times to close (Recommended by friend) (I have not worked on this feature and I am waiting for maybe a future release)

The done list:
 Program itself:
  - (Done) set a number of how many cats should be deployed
  - (Done) custom file directory?
  - (Done) set a amount of time for how long the cursor should be still before opening the program
  - (Done) Add a kill switch for disabling the script
  - (Done) Instead of a static Stand_still number make it a random one
  - (Done) Have a inital waiting time before the stand_still number will be used
  - (Done) Have a random image pop-up out of nowhere instead of a static/random waiting time
 JSON configs:
  - (Done) Set random number range (Default is normally between 2-100)
  - (Done) Prototype should work with JSONs EXECPT for the kill switch!
  - (Done) Improve cat collection before release
